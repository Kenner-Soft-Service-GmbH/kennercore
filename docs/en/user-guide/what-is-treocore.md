# What is KennerCore

KennerCore is an open-source software ecosystem developed by [KenerSoft Service GmbH](https://treolabs.com/) and distributed under GPLv3 License for free. TreCore is designed for rapid development of web-based responsive business applications of any kind (ERP, PIM, CRM, DMS, MDM, DAM, etc.). It has a lot of features right out-of-the box and thus is an excellent tool for cost-effective and timely application development.

KennerCore is a single page application (SPA) with an API-centric, service-oriented architecture, and flexible data model based on configurable entities and relations. You can organize any data and business-related processes directly in KennerCore, many of them via a simple and user-friendly configuration.

## For Whom

KennerCore is the best fit **for businesses**, who want to:

- solve custom business problems;
- store data and organize business processes;
- set up and use a middleware to connect with the third-party systems;
- create added value and best experience for their employees, customers, and partners;
- extend the functionality of the existing software infrastructure.

## KennerCore Add-Ons

The following add-on applications are available on the KennerCore basis:

All three applications can be used in a single instance as well as extended with numerous modules. Please, see the details on the modules available for you in our [store](https://treopim.com/store).

## Main KennerCore Concepts

### Concept of Entity

An entity is any singular, identifiable and separate object or unit of data that can be classified and have stated relationships to other entities. The entities are used to model and manage business data. For example, in KennerCore the following entities are used by default: Account, Contact, Email, Stream, Team, User, etc. 

Each entity in the system can have many records. These entity records can be managed and operated with on various [views](./views-and-panels-core.md) available in the KennerCore system.

### Concept of Data Auditing

Each entity field can be set to be audited or not. When this option is activated by the administrator, all the changes made to the field value for a certain record are logged and shown in the activity stream as follows: old value, new value, who has made the change and when. 

Please, note that the concept of data auditing is the foundation of the **"Revisions"** module, which provides you with the ability to easily operate with the change history. Please, see the details in our [store](https://treopim.com/store/revisions).
